This is a HTTP Client implementation in C. Currently it supports only GET and POST methods.

Following files are part of this implementation:

http_client.c
http_client.h
http_error.h
http_client_test.c
Makefile

http_client.c implements the HTTP methods. It currently supports only GET and POST methods.
http_client.h exposes the functions which can be used for having these methods.
http_error.h lists different error codes which the client implementation can throw to help in debugging.
http_client_test.c shows example of how the GET and POST methods can be used.
Makefile provides the script for building the whole mdoule
To build the module, use "make" command. To clean it use "make clean" command.
 
Building the module creates a executable called httpclienttest which allows the test of GET and POST methods as follows:
To test GET method, please use the command:
./httpclienttest get
To test POST methods please use the command:
./httpclienttest post

The test uses predefined server information and other parameters which can be found in the http_client_test.c file.
